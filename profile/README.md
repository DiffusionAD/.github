# Diffusion AD


:raised_hands: DiffusionAD​​ is a research team ​​focused on fully harnessing​​ the power of ​​diffusion models​​ for autonomous driving systems. Our ​​research interests​​ lie in:

- ​​Diffusion model with efficient and effective architecture design​​ for ​​​​autonomous driving systems
- Diffusion-based IL/RL algorithms​​ for ​​generalizable and robust​​ autonomous driving systems
- ​​Diffusion-based​​ autonomous driving systems (​​Perception-Planning / End-to-End / VLA​​)

Projects:

- [Diffusion-Planner (ICLR 2025 oral): Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance](https://github.com/DiffusionAD/Diffusion-Planner)
